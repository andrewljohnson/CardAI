This project lets you battle AIs against each other, that play a CCG-like card game.

## Run the code.

By default, it will play a Monte Carlo Search Tree bot vs. a Random bot.

```
python bin/battle-bots.py
```

You can change the defaults, for example to play two Monte Carlo Search Tree bots against each other with 10 starting life.

```
python bin/battle-bots.py --players 2 2 --starting_hit_points 10
```
